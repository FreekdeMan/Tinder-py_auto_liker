<h1>Tinder-Py Auto Liker</h1>
<p>
This simple python program was developed both out of curiosity to see how Tinders internal API communicates and to allow for systematic, unsupervised liking of profiles, as living in a large city such as London has meant that the market has become super-saturated. This has lead to the majority of guys using the <i>'swipe right for all'</i> technique to increase their chance of getting any sort of match, which in turn has saturated the market even further (as currently Tinder queues the people who have liked a profile in that profiles first recommendations). So in an attempt to beat through this crowd movement (and yes, I do realise this is a case of "if you can't beat them join them") the tinder-py_auto_liker script will carry on liking all profiles that become available based on your predefined search paramters.
